# PDIndexer
* *PDIndexer* is an analysis software for powder diffraction studies.
* Runs on Windows with .Net Framework 4.8.

## Install
* Access https://github.com/seto77/PDIndexer/releases/latest, download *PDIndexerSetup.msi*, and execute it.

## Main features
* Works with diffractometry of (synchrotron-) X-ray or neutron-TOF.
* Displays profile(s) and
  * Processing of smoothing, removal of K_alpha2, interpolation, 
  * Supports many file formats (e.g., csv, tsv, ras, nxs, npd, chi, xbm, rpt, ...).
* Fitting of diffraction peaks of any crystals.
  * Includes crystal database function. Initially ~80 crystal data are bundled. 
  * Calculates pressure using EOS (equation of states)
